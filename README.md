#character-website

I was using a platform to organize characters from various of my stories, but they limited how I could code and design my character profiles behind a paywall. They also used Bootstrap, which is probably great for coders who are new or only know that, but it felt like relearning html. Very frusterationg.

So I'm making my own website to organize them.
